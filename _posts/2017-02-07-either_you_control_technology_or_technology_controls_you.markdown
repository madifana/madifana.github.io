The title of this blog is one of the primary reasons I started learning to program.  Time and again I would find myself wishing a program existed to make accomplishing certain tasks easier.  Sometimes I would find something very similar to what I wanted, but not close enough to be useful for my purposes.  Either that, or it was exactly what was needed, but was too expensive to be worth the purchase.

I would also find myself coming up with what I thought were pretty decent ideas for "Apps" that, if I could introduce them to the market myself, would allow me to contribute to society...and possibly profit a little in the process.  Of course the farthest I would get would be to write down a brief description of how the program would work with the full intent to figure out the details later.  Predictably, within the next 6 months a program similar to my idea would show up in the market and I would be sad.

Besides that, I'm the type of person who likes to do things himself.  If a sink gets clogged or my car breaks down, I roll up my sleeves and grab some tools.  It has always been very annoying to me that my ability to navigate technology is completely limited to the programs other people have created.  It makes me feel like I'm being led around on a virtual leash, only able to do what others tell me I can do.

If someone wants to do something simple like create a website, they have 2 choices.  They can either pay someone to build it, or they can use website development services that provide limited capabilities but allow a person to create a site with no programming knowledge.  The first option can cost thousands of dollars and the second will leave you with a website that looks like a thousand others.

Most people will be totally content spending the majority of their time on the newest social network, search engine, or phone app, waiting for their favorite software company to tell them what the next "big thing" is.  A few of us would rather create our own.
